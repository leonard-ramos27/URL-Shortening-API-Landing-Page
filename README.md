## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript 
- Fetch API and LocalStorage


### What I learned

I was able to learn more about using Fetch API. This site is using shrtco.de API which is the API provided in the challenge instructions in order to shorten the links which used to work at first however, at this time it seems that this API is down and so it might not be able to proceed with shortening the link. 

### Continued development

I think it is best to use a different API moving forward since the current API seems to be down.
